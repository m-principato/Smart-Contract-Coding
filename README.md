# SmartContract-Coding
Coding Project for the module "Introduction to Blockchain Technology".

For security reasons, we make use of the code from the OpenZeppelin repository (https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/), which contains tested and constantly updated smart contract standards.
Further we make use of SafeMath to avoid integer over- and underflows, which are common attack vectors against smart contracts.
